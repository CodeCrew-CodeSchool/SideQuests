# Javascript Functions, Pair Programming

# Overview
Pair programming is a collaborative software development practice where two programmers work together at a single workstation. One assumes the role of the driver, actively writing code, while the other becomes the navigator, offering real-time feedback, suggestions, and strategic guidance. This approach promotes code quality, problem-solving skills, and knowledge sharing, as both participants bring diverse perspectives and expertise to the task. Pair programming enhances communication, reduces errors, and fosters a culture of learning and teamwork within a development environment.
