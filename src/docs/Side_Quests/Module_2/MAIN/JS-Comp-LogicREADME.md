# Computational Logic
# Overview
Computational logic is the foundation of programming, guiding how computers execute tasks. It involves logical operations, including AND, OR, and NOT, to manipulate data and make decisions. By combining these operations, programmers create algorithms that control the flow of a program, ensuring tasks are executed accurately and efficiently. Computational logic is essential for constructing reliable and functional software systems.

- Students will explain how computers work, using technical terminology, at more than one level of detail.
- Students will implement for and while loops to accomplish meaningful tasks in their code.

# Reading
