# Functions

# Overview
Functions are essential building blocks in programming that encapsulate a set of instructions within a reusable unit. They enable developers to break down complex tasks into manageable chunks of code, improving code organization, reusability, and maintainability. Functions take input parameters, process them using the defined logic, and can optionally return results. They play a vital role in controlling the flow of a program by enabling modular design and reducing code duplication. Functions are present in various programming languages and allow developers to create efficient, readable, and structured code. By using functions, programmers can model real-world processes, enhance code clarity, and design efficient and scalable applications.

- Students will be able to create a script as a sequence of steps, executable by the computer, to achieve a stated goal.
- Students will encapsulate code in functions, modeling steps in a process.
- Students will apply new techniques to existing code, increasing code clarity, without losing any functionality.
