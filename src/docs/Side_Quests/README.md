# Welcome to the Side Quests!

This corner of the curriculum is designed to be a place for info on deeper concepts that are tangential to what is covered in the main curriculum. There's also overviews on some of the roles you can pursue and specialize in after completing the MAIN course.

# HOW-TO

#### NOTE: Each specific role currently has a list of terms that it will be helpful for you to look up. Module 1 does contain a larger idea map and links to various career paths and subjects to study for them. Stay tuned for more in depth updates on each job type in each module.

# Google 

[Start here](https://grow.google/certificates/) especially if you're interested in broader tech work outside of programming. 

* Choose A Path, based on your career aspirations and interests
* Don't shy away from the "Advance Your Career" Options either. They're great continuing education as bootcamp grads interested in further programming skills
* The main 6 courses aren't directly programming focused. IT Support, Cyber Security, UX Design, and Data Analytics are great additional info to know as a Developer
* Digital Marketing will help if you'd like to freelance and build websites and services that are common needs amongst startups, small businesses, and individuals
