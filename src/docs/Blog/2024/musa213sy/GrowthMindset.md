## Growth Mindset

Growth mindset  to me is being able to learn something you never knew before. It may give you problems the first few time, but eventually you able to understand the topic and master it with ease

## Reminders
<ul>
<li>Finish the task at hand</li>
<li>look for ways to improve</li>
<li>Be encouraged to face challenges</li>
</ul>
