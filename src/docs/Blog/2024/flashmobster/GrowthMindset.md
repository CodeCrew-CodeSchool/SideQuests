>***Growth mindset*** is refusing to give up in the face of adversity. Those who push through the difficult part of situations receive the best rewards. Naturally, when trying to learn new things we'll hit roadblocks.It how we respond and adapt to these changes that determine whether one is in a **[fixed mindset](https://tophat.com/glossary/f/fixed-mindset/ "People who see their qualities as fixed traits that cannot change.")** or **[growth mindset](https://tophat.com/glossary/g/growth-mindset/ "People who believe that their success depends on time and effort")**. Naturally,this means that those in the **growth mindset** and **lifelong learners** are synonymous. Learning and progress never end.

## Keep in Mind

1. If you don't know something,there no shame in asking to find the answer.
1. Rome wasn't built in a day. We must practice what we want to become good at.
1. Learning never ends. Situations constantly evolve so we need to continue studying.
