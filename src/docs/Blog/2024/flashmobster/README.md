# Flashmobster's Blog

***

This is my curated blog for **Code Crew 2024**. I seek to understand Javascript, CSS, HTML, Python, and other programming languages throughout the course. I'd like to use my understanding of bash scripting and cybersecurity to become a professinal in the tech space in both hardware and software. I'd also like to apply my learning to understand sports through an analytical perspective using programs.
