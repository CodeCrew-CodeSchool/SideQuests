 # Growth Mindset

If you're someone who embraces challenges,learns from past mistakes or believes personal development, whether it be physical, mental, or emotional is important. Then you're moving through lifes ups and downs with a growth mindset.

 ## **So, What is Growth Mindset?**

A growth mindset is defined as a belief that an individual can improve or become more knowledgeable by being persistent and remaining open to learning new skills which in turn help you achieve more and reach your goals.

So whats the difference between the two? A fixed mindset is when a person believes that intelligence, talents, and other qualities are things that can't be changed. They also believe that if you're not good at something, you'll never be good at it which limits them from reaching their full potential. So the difference between these two mindsets is that a growth mindset embraces and is open to learning new things through constant perserverance, where as, a fixed mindset believes that even if you work hard it doesn't make a difference so they're more prone to quit alot quicker in comparison.
