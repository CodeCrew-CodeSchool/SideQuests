<h1>Growth Mindset</h1>

My interpretation of a growth mindset is the theme of trail and error always ending in growth whether its in the aspect of awarness or how you handle a task.
*<p>3 reminders to keep a growing mindset</p>*

- focusing on my priorities and completing them within a timely manner

- enhancing my skills on thinking more critically instead of being irrational

- preventing mistakes from making me discouraged and just turning them into lessons
