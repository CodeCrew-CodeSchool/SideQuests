### Growth Mindset

### What does growth mindset mean to me?

- A growth mindset is knowing how and why you are you pushing yourself to your goals and **proactivly acting on chances** to attain them.

- A growth mindset is having the resiliency to push through hard times and let downs and not let **failure** succeed.

- A growth mindset is not being a bird soaring at insect height. Meaning that you dont come this with far just to have a mediocre mindset at the first sign of success.
