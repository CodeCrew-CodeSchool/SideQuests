# Growth Mindset Thoughts and Musings

A growth mindset is a set of beliefs and actions that create progress despite challenges and obstacles.

- Accept challenges as defining moments, moments to showcase your values and rise to the occasion

- Treat obstacles as silly adventures/tasks to reflect on later

- It's all for character development!
