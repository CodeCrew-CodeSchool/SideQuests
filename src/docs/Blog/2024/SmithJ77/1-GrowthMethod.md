A growth mindset is the belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed through effort, learning, and perseverance. It contrasts with a fixed mindset, which sees capabilities as innate and unchangeable. Embracing a growth mindset fosters resilience, motivation, and a positive attitude toward challenges, promoting continuous learning and personal development
