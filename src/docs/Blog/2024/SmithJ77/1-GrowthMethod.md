# Growth Mindset

## What is Growth Mindset?

Growth mindset, to me, is allowing you to expand your knowledge and constantly learning and retaining of information.

<p>3 Ways I remind myself to stay in a growth mindset!</p> 

1. I keep practicing what I have learned.
2. Take what others can teach me and expand on it.
3. I continue to believe I can and improve on what I already know.
