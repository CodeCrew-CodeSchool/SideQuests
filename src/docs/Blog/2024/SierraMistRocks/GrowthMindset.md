# Growth Mindset Thoughts and Musings

A growth mindset is a set of beliefs and actions that create progress despite challenges and obstacles. A sort of removed and involved way of looking at growth mindset is viewing life as a novel, or journal, instead of a story. There are chapters to life that are hard to see when you're in them. 

- Accept challenges as defining moments, moments to showcase your values and rise to the occasion.

- Treat obstacles as silly adventures/tasks to reflect on later.

- It's all for character development!
