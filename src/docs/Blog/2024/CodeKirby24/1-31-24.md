## My Definition
A growth mindset to me is self explainatory. In simple terms, is a way of thinking that allows you to achieve personal growth.Whether you're doing such things as learning a new skill, completeing a task, or helping someone, your thought process is important for overcoming these things. You believe that you can aquire new skills and also build upon preexisting ones. I find the growth mindset to be hard to achieve, since I'm always ready to give up at the earliest convenince. It's easy to say that you can't do something even without trying it, but you'll never get fullfilled life thinking like this.

## Three Reminders
- Seek Support
 - There's no shame in seeking out help when you need it. Knowing when you need assistance and taking the courage to ask for it can help you grow more than you expect.
- Less Planning, More Doing
 - Of course you'll need a plan for things, but dont use that as an excuse to put stuff off. A plan is nothing without action.
- Always Try Again
 - It's okay to take a break, but always make an attempt. You'll never know if you can succeed this time without trying.
