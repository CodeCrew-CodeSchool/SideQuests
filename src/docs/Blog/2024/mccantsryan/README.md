# Growth mindset

### Introduction
 I would define a "Growth mindset"  is an attempt of self preservation motive that will take an individual to a benefitial goal
 My first way to stay focused is to indulge in my  coding activities everyday.
  Another way is to start to seek out individuals who are in this field and try to get into more if I can get more help and insight.
 Finally is to remind myself and others if I can,  that we are all doubtful but we will succeed.
