Hello my name is Ryan McCants and I welcome you and your unique mindset
The way i would define a "Growth mindset" is an attempt of self preservation motive that will take an individual to a benefitial goal
One of my ways to stay focused is to indulge in my  coding activities everyday.
Another one of my tactics is to start to seek out individuals who are in this field and try to get into more if I can get more help and insight.
My last plan is to remind myself and others if I can,  that we are all doubtful but we will succeed
