### growth mindset 

### what does growth mindset means to me?
it means to fully incorporate your self into the journey that you always wanted to start , now the only thing left to do is to challenge yourself to continue to strive to become better everyday so you can achieve those goals sooner than you think . the growth mindset is supposed to explain to you how no matter the dificult periods you encounter your self in , you will always strive to learn something new or fix your mistakes to grow within your mindset and commit yourself to grow your intellect every single day

### reminder
i used to work construction with my dad from 7am to 6:30 pm, deep down i always knew working tech was the coolest thing i could throw my self into to learn. after  1 year of construction i realized i needed to challenge my self to find something i actually like to do since construction is very intense and you work long hours for the same salary others do in tech. every day i got home tired and stressed and feeling like i wasnt doing enough , pushed me to find a solution to my problems , i remind my self everyday that i have to be gratefull for what god puts and takes away in my life and to take eduction seriously because i want to see my self succcessful in the future
