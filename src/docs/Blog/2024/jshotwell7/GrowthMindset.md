### Growth Mindset

### What does growth mindset mean to me?

A growth mindset means to me, is being able to adjust to any situation with any incoming adversity. Coming out on top and being able to say that you made it from the other side.

Understanding that in some ways you may be lacking, but also understanding that you have what it takes to succeed and overcome those challenges.

With growth also comes a love for learning or love for whatever it is that you are trying to grow in. Whether that is fitness, faith, financial literacy all these topics have situations.

I think <strong>3 Reminders</strong> of having a growth mindset is:
<ol>
    <li>Understanding your why.</li>
    <li>Be patient with your goals. Understand that this is a journey.</li>
    <li>Realize that this will journey will test you in ways that you may not think that you ready for but you will see that you are.</li>
