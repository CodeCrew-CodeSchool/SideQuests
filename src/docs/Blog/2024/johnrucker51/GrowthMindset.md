### <h1>Growth Mindset </h1>


### What does growth mindset mean to me?

<p>A growth mindset for me is not settling. Even though we have a set of beliefs/perspectives on how we view things, it's the urge to push beyond & explore more;not being content in it. Always have a knack to wanting to improve. Example, a lot of people say they're "<em><strong>GROWN</strong></em>". In my eyes, you're putting a cap on your potential & think you know it all when in reality,you're far from it. I''ll compare having a growth mindset to a muscle: the more you challenge it & work on it, you'll see results versus when you don't utilize your muscle, you'll have no gains & sometimes lose what you have. Long story short keep your head on a swivel;<strong>NEVER LACK</strong>!
