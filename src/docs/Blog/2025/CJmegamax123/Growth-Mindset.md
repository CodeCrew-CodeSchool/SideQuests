# A Healthy Balance
In my opinion, a growth mindset is a great tool and perspective to how one should broach challenges they've encounter. While being flexible in your way of thinking can lead to many improvements, being fixed in your beliefs can also be a strong ethical and moral foundation for how to navigate life and challenges as well. I believe **BOTH** are not just advised, but required in order to be a truly well-rounded individual.

## 3 Reminders on how to keep improving!
1. **ALWAYS** keep being *CJ* first and foremost.
2. Keep an open mind, knowledge can come from anywhere
3. Be willing to help others up with you, people are more powerful together than alone
