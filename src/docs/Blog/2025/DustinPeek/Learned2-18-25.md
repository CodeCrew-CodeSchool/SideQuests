# Key Takeaways from class on 2-18

These are by far the best takeaways I've had from my class today:

* The DOM was introduced to us today and is going to be the what we use to modify objects on our page using JavaScript, which in some ways can be similar to CSS but not entirely. To be specific, DOM is more about data and its structure and CSS/Box Model is more focused on the visually aesthetic part of an element.
* The above being said, you can still edit parameters and values with JavaScript but using the ".style" notation in your code.

Admittedly, I didn't think we would loop right back into CSS concepts so quickly after jumping into JavaScript, but I wasn't opposed to it. Trying to figure out how to restructure the syntax to do the same thing took me a little bit to get a handle on, and I'll definitely need to keep practicing, but I think I can figure it out.
