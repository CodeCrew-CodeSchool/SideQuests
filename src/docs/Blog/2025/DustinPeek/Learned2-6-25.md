# Key Takeaways from class on 2-6

These are by far the best takeaways I've had from my class today:

* When using "form" tags, the "label" tags nested inside of them can have their information go to specific locations based on the "name" attribute added to them. Such as adding "body" to a textarea's tag so that it shows up in the body of an email.
* When using the inspect function on a site, I can identify element information based on colors. Examples of this being Blue for the element itself, Green for any padding, and Yellow for borders.
* adding "./" to a file's path means that the path leads to the folder you are currently in. adding more elipses will add levels up from said file. So "../" will go one level up from the current file, so on and so forth.

The process we learned today of creating forms gave me insight into how I could create forms or surveys in the future. Creating said forms included deciding between multiple types of different inputs to get the information I would need to ask from the user. I'll need to study more about Regex (Regular Expressions) to make sure I know what my options are when creating these in the future.
