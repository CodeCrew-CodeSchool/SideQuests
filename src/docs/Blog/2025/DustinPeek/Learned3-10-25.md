# Key Takeaways from class on 3-10

These are by far the best takeaways I've had from my class today:

* Today we began diving into the concept of objects and how to attach properties of an object using dot and bracket notation. We also learned about attaching objects to objects using .prototype
* We also learned about UI Libraries and the difference between them and UI Frameworks. Summarily being how UI Libraries are better for adapting to your code in a plug and play format whereas UI Frameworks are good for making your UI, but have a bit more rules you have to play by to properly use and take advantage them as a resource.
