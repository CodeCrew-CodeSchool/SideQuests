# Key Takeaways from class on 2-17

These are by far the best takeaways I've had from my class today:

* We began our intro into our third language, JavaScript, today. This is implemented into your HTML by either uses a "script" element or by using a separate js file. We mainly focused on the script element itself.
* We learned about how to assign and call variables to strings or numbers, and also how to have these variables print their values into the console with the console.log function

JavaScript is the language I'm the most excited to learn about since this is where we will start getting into the metaphorical meat and potatoes of the code. While we are only doing foundational work right now, I'm ready to start seeing what we do in the future and how deep this goes.
