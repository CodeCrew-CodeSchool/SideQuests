# Growth Mindset

To me, a growth mindset is one that comes in ready to not only learn, but also to fail. Practicing a new skill or trying to educate yourself on a new idea/topic/skill means getting some things wrong along the way. Knowing this, keep the following things in mind when it comes to having that growth mindset:

* It's okay to fail or not understand some things
* Be open to new ideas
* Keep yourself motivated and never give up
