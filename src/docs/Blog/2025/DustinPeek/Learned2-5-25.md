# Key takeaways from class on 2-5

These are by far the best takeaways I've had from my class today:

* GIF's actual pronunciation, does in fact sound like JIF, but I'm going to say it incorrectly anyway.
* PNG files have access to RGBA whereas JPG only have access to RGB.
* The elements "audio", "video", and "iframe" can all be used to embed videos or sound content into a page and audio/video can have different sources nested within them.

We also learned how to implement the aforementioned elements in a multi-layered webpage that people could explore. (When I say multi-layered, I mean a webpage or repo that has multiple files that all connect to each other with links. I have no clue if that's good terminology to use here.) To implement the elements, we learned how to copy the embed from a YouTube video and attach the related iframe element into an HTML document. We also learned how to do a Google Maps iframe but never used it for the project today so I'll practice that one on my own.
