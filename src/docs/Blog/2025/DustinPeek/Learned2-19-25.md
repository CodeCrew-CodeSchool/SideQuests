# Key Takeaways from class on 2-19

These are by far the best takeaways I've had from my class today:

* Today we started to get into Events and addEventListeners, which are going to be how a majority of the cool things work on a page from my understanding.
* These events and listeners can be triggered by a variety of actions, such as clicking on something. All the programmer needs to do is specify how this event will be triggered with a listener.

While I was and am still excited to learn about JavaScript and what can be done with it, I definitely could feel the information overload kick in a bit from this class session. It may be because this feels so similar to the animations from CSS after looking at the lab? But I'm ready to get into it all the same.
