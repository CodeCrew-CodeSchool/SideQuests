# Key Takeaways from class on 2-10

These are by far the best takeaways I've had from my class today:

* We learned about the basics of CSS, which will allow us to change the aesthetic properties of any of our elements or images
* We learned about how we can change color, size, background, etc. by selecting the property in our syntax and then inputting our value that we want to change the property to.

CSS is probably going to be the one of the three coding languages I will be struggling with the most, and is kind of what I expected coming into this program. I tend to not think artistically and I think it may hinder me, but we'll see when I get the practice in.
