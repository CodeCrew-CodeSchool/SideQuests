# Key Takeaways from class on 2-13

These are by far the best takeaways I've had from my class today:

* Media Queries are one side of the coin on how the real magic happens with CSS to make things visually appealing by adding a variety of characteristics to attributes/propeties once interacted with in a certain way.
* Animations will be the other side of the coin and show even more of the magic by allowing us to determine how long properties of an element will do some kind of action as well as what that action will be.

This is where I am probably the most intimidated when it comes to CSS since I know I mentioned my inability to think a bit more artistically but maybe with more practice this can come a bit more naturally. I don't know how good my sense of theatrics will be but I will definitely make an effort to think about what would be easier on the user's eyes.
