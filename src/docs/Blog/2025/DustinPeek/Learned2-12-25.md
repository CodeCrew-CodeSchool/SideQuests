# Key Takeaways from class on 2-12

These are by far the best takeaways I've had from my class today:

* The Box Model was the topic of the day I was the most focused on. We learned about the structure of the Box Model of an element and spoke on the structure of said Box Model: Content, Padding, Border, Margin
* We also discussed more about the types of selectors we could use to target elements more accurately, such as various ways to select child elements using selectors such as ":only-child", ":first-child", or ":nth-child". Obviously, there were many more thanks to the practice we had with the CSS Diner, but that touches on a couple of the basics.

The Box Model was by far the most helpful for me today though. When trying to learn CSS before coming to this program, I had a hard time visualizing and understanding what exactly margin and padding did for an element and it seemed like incomprehensible magic when I worked on freeCodeCamp. Now that I have a visual I can understand, and saw it better using inspect, I have a much clearer understanding of what I'm dealing with.
