# Key Takeaways from class on 2-11

These are by far the best takeaways I've had from my class today:

* We learned about some more of the basics of CSS, partly focusing on External, Internal, and Inline CSS.
The other part focusing on the different ways to select elements with selectors.
* Attaching CSS to html documents can be done in one of 3 ways: External, Internal, and Inline. External means linking a separate CSS document to the html document. Internal means you will type up the CSS code within the html sheet. Inline means it will be a style attribute associated with an element. Each of these ways to add CSS have their pros and cons, so you need to determine what works best for the project you're working on.
* Selectors come in a wide variety of types and can be used to target specific elements of the page to change the style of. These specific selections can be as specific as picking one of three of the same kind of element nested within a parent element, maybe even picking the 2nd one specifically, or it could be as broad as selecting every single element on the page.
