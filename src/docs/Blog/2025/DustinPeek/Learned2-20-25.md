# Key Takeaways from class on 2-20

These are by far the best takeaways I've had from my class today:

* I used the readings to learn about Inline vs Internal JavaScript today and came to the conclusion that I think I prefer Internal JavaScript. I think I, personally, just prefer to have my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all separate to make it easier to digest. Plus I learned about the "defer" attribute that I can add to my "script" element to make it load in parallel to the pages parsing. It seems to be effective so far but we'll see how it does over time.
