# Week 2 Day 2 - February 11, 2025
## CSS - Inline vs Style vs Link Elements

Today we delved deeper in CSS. The lecture centered on styling with CSS and we looked further into how to style different fonts. Using different effects such as text shadow. One thing that I look forward to trying out is using google fonts to try out different fonts. We also looked at the different CSS selectors and combinations and separators. We did some exercises with the different selectors in class and then went on to do a CSS selector game. 

For the lab today, we did an exercise where we created separate pages, one using inline css and the other using internal css. I found it much easier to use the internal CSS. With the inline css, I wasn't always clear on where to put the style attribute.
