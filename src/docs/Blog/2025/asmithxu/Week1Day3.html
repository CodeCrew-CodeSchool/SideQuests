    <h1>Week 1 Day 3 - Links and Media Elements</h1>
    <p>Today we explored media elements, including elements for images, video, and audio. We also learned how to <strong>embed</strong> a video using the iframe element and created
         a website with two ebedded videos about Outdoor Adventures. You can see my website <a href="https://asmithxu.github.io/OutdoorAdventure/" target="blank">here</a></p>
    <p>Embedding is important because it allows you to display the video on your webpage but the video is hosted elsewhere. It allows you embed another html page into your webpage</p>
    <P>We learned that there are several different image formulas including jpg, gif, and png. We also learned that the the paragraph inside the video element is called <strong>fallback content</strong>. This is the content that will load if the browser does not support the video player.</P>
