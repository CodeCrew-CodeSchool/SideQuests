# Week 2 Day 1 - February 10, 2025
## CSS Intro - Images, Color, Style

Today we got an introduction to CSS. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it can add visual styling to a webpage. There are three ways to insert CSS - external, internal, and inline. If you insert it externally you would do it in a separate file. If you do it internally you would use a style block and if you do it inline, you would add it as an attribute in HTML. DJ indicated that we would use the external method the most due to the "separation of concerns". He indicated that it would be easier to find parts of the code that were causing issues if we used the external method. 

We started adding CSS to out about me page. I chose to do it with the external method, but I ran into problems. The code would show on the home page, but would not carry over to the other pages. Also, it would disappear once I returned to my home page. 

We also went into an interesting discussion of Hexadecimal. We learned that it was base 16 and that we would use it to find colors. It is definitely something that I want to learn more about.
