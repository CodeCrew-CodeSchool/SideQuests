# Week 5 Day 1 - March 3, 2025
## Intro to Arrays

Today was our introduction to arrays. We had a review that involved creating a website that listed what we had learned and what we needed to review. The website needed some styling and buttons that gave an alert with javascript. I found that I got stuck in different areas creating my website, which indicated to me that I should practice setting up websites more and getting more comfortable with linking javascript and css. 

The homework involved initializing an array and then adding and changing values in it. The assignment seemed straightforward, but I found it easy to miss steps.
