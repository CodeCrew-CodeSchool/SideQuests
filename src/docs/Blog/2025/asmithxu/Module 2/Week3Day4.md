# Week 3 Day 4 - February 20, 2025
## Inline Javascript Vs Internal Javascript

Today was mainly a review day. I was able to work on FreeCodeCamp and complete the puppeteering lab from yesterday. I feel like I am still working my way to feeling comfortable about Javascript. In Free Code Camp I learned more about arrays and using brackets and counting which was helpful. The actions that we are doing in class seem fairly straightforward. It was definitely easier to animate the emojis with javascript than with CSS. However, it is still coming together for me.
