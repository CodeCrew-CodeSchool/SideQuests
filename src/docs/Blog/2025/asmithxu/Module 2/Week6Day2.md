# Week 6 Day 2 - March 11, 2025
## Arrays of Objects

Our objective today included constructing objects, storing and manipulating objects in Arrays, using the Array object's filter method, applying actions to every array item using the map method, recognizing JSON notation, and customizing callback functions.

Key terms for today included:
+ JSON notation - this is Javascript Object Notation and it involves writing the object as name:value pairs.
+ Inheritance and prototypes - javascript objects inherit properties and methods from other objects. One way to do this is with constructor functions.
+ Composition - With object composition, we can create complex objects by combining similar objects and functions.
+ Usefulness of objects in describing a group of related variables - objects are useful in describing a group of related variables because the objects create relationships between the variables and can apply methods to them.
+ Arrow functions - arrow functions define a function like this () => { }. They are a simpler method of writing functions and can be used within methods that use functions like the map method.
