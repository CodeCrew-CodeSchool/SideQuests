# Week 7 Day 1 - March 17, 2025
## Application Structure

Today we reviewed some build-in function and language features including:

+ getElementByClassName()
+ getAttribute() - this retrieved the value of a specified attribute of an HTML element.
+ innerHTML - this is the property of DOM elements that gets or sets. 

Some of the language features included:

+ for-loops
+ Array Indexing
+ forEach on node lists. You can use the forEach() method to list through nodeLists but this is not applicable to HTML collections. 

We explored how large website projects are set up with DJ and he pointed out some different ways that they set up the folders. Some included:
 + gitIgnore - this is a folder that will be stored locally and never published to the internet. It will contain very sensitive data such as cybersecurity features. You would need to share information from this folder with members of your team a different way. 

 + components folder - this folder will contain different elements of the website. 

 + build folder - this folder would contain an output that would be running. 

 + news folder - this folder had an rss feed and app structures when we examined it.


 This lab for today included automatically loading a webpage to include categories of a book. We looped through the categories folder to upload the books. I found it tricky and got caught up at the end - mixed up some parameters and arguments in a function.
