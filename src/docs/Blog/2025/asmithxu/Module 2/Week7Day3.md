# Week 7 Day 3 - March 19, 2025
## Debugging and Programming Beyond the Browser

Today we explored debugging and programming beyond the browser and started to use node.js. We looked at breakpoints which are automatic steps in the code and learned about the difference between syntax errors and logical errors in javascript. A syntax error occurs when a character is incorrectly placed in the code. This is what will usually cause error messages. a logical error occurs when there is an error in the logic of the code. This doesn't usually result in an error message. The class downloaded node.js and we practiced using it. One way that we practiced was from the browser. We set a breakpoint in the javascript and then opened it in the browser from the html file. We also examined the code from just the javascript. DJ showed us how we can look into the function and also how we can see different variables in the code. I learned that if we want to look into the function we can do that when the function is called.
