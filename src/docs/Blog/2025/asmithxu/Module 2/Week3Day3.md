# Week 3 Day 3 - February 19, 2025
## Javascript Events

Today was a snowday so the class was on Zoom. We went over javascript events. Events are anything that happens on a webpage. We learned about anonymous functions - a function that doesn't have a name as well as the cycle of a webpage - how the webpage loads from top to bottom. I can see how understanding the cycle of a webpage will be extremely important when designing the webpage. 

We learned that math.floor will round your number down to x.0 and math.random will generate a random number between 0 and 1. We reviewed some codes and used it to change the colors on a webpage. One question was "How can we get rid of the decimal entirely?" and the and the answer was by using math.floor.
