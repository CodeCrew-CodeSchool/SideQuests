## Objects of Arrays

Today we focused on utilizing arrays that are properties of objects.

We learned about the difference between inheritance and composition in Javascript. Composition means to compose and helps create clean reusable objects.

Inheritance means gaining some or all of the functionality of a parent and providing a relational structure.

The filter method creates a shallow copy of a portion of a given array filtered down to just the elements from the given array that pass the test implemented by the provided funtion.

The map method created a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
