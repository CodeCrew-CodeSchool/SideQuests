# Week 4 Day 1 - February 24, 2025
## Intro to Operators & Control Flow

Today we learned about operators and control flow. Control is the order that computers executes a website. Understanding control flow can help prevent errors. Operators can help control the logic of the code (logical operators like +, -, +=), compare values in the code (comparison operators like ==), or assign values (+=, =). We also were introduced to loops which allow for sections of code to be repeated.
