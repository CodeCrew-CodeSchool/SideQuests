## Into to Objects

Today we had our introduction to objects. Objects allow us to group related pieces of information. This allows for easier abstractions and to design larger, more integrated systems.

Some terms include:

+ Objects - 
+ Object literals - Object literals help define an object. It includes and comma-separated list of key-value pairs enclosed within curly braces. The keys are strings and the values can be any data type.
+ New keyword and constructor functions - The new keyword is used to create an instance of an object. Constructor functions use the new keyword to create and initialize objects.
+ Inheritance - inheritance allows objects to acquire properties and methods from other objects.
+ Prototypes - Prototypes are the mechanism by which Javascript objects inherit features from one another.
