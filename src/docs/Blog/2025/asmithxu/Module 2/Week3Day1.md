# Week 3 Day 1 - February 18, 2025
## Intro to Javascript

At the beginning of the day we had a review of Agape with ToNaya and Chris. For the code school we began Javascript. Java is a programming language that can be used for client-side web development and it enables dynamic features. We learned about the different types of data types such as strings, integers and booleans and practiced defining variables with the let function. We practiced the code in a program called codex and I got caught up with one question because I had rogue quotation marks in front of the comment. 

When we worked on the lab, we practiced concatenating different strings. I learned that when you concatenate you can simply use the plus sign in the console log funtion.
