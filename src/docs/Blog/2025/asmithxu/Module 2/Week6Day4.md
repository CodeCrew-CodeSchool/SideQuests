# Week 6 Day 4 - March 13, 2025
## Quiz on Objects

Today we had a quiz on objects. This involved learning about canvas in Javascript and creating a bouncing balls repo using canvas. 

DJ did a demonstration of canvas that showed how to draw various objects using canvas. Some of the things that we saw how to create included circles, boxes, a panorama, and a color-picker. The options seemed very complex, but DJ reassured us that the website provides us with templates that we can use for our own projects.
