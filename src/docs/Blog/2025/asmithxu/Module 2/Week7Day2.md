# Week 7 Day 2 - March 18, 2025
## Browser Storage

Today we learned about different types of storage, including local storage, session storage, and cookies. 

Local storage stores information locally in the browser and you can see this in the browser through the search console. It will cause the information to persist even when you go to visit a different page and you can even pull the information in different parts of the website. It will only get deleted with javascript or when the user clears the browser history.

The session storage is similar to local storage and even uses similar keywords. The information will be lost when the user session ends

Another way of storing information is through cookies and these can help with session management, personalization, and tracking.
