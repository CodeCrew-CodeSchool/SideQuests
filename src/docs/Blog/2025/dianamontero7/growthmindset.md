## A growth mindset is all about believing you can improve with effort and persistence. Talent and smarts are just the starting line—it’s your drive to learn and grow that really makes the difference.


# 3 Self Reminders to Stay in a Growth Mindset

## 1. Progress Over Perfection
It’s easy to get caught up in wanting to do everything just right, but I remind myself that growth isn’t about being perfect—it’s about improving. Every mistake is just another step forward.

## 2. Challenges = Opportunities
When something feels hard, my first instinct is to get frustrated. But instead of seeing challenges as roadblocks, I try to reframe them as opportunities to learn. If I already knew everything, I wouldn’t be growing!

## 3. Effort Always Pays Off
Even if I don’t see immediate results, I know that the effort I put in today will build up over time. Whether it’s a new skill, a project, or just a shift in mindset, consistency is what makes the difference.


> A growth mindset isn’t about having it all figured out—it’s about believing that with time and effort, I will get better. And that’s a reminder I always try to keep close.
