### DOM
The DOM is a programming interface that browsers implement to represent the structure of a webpage. Think of it as a tree-like structure where each node corresponds to a part of the document (like an element or attribute). This model allows developers to access and manipulate HTML and XML documents using JavaScript.

### API
An API is a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications. In web development, APIs allow different software components to communicate. For instance, you might use an API to retrieve data from a server or to integrate third-party services into your application.

### Query Selectors
Query Selectors are powerful tools for selecting elements within the DOM. JavaScript provides methods like querySelector and querySelectorAll that allow developers to target elements using CSS-style selectors.


### Element Properties
Element Properties are attributes or characteristics of DOM elements that you can access or modify using JavaScript. These properties provide crucial information about the element and can also be changed to affect how the element behaves on the webpage.
