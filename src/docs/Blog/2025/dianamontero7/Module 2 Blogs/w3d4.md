### Inline Javascript
Inline JavaScript refers to JavaScript code written directly within an HTML element’s attribute—typically within event handlers like onclick, onmouseover, or onchange. This method allows developers to trigger JavaScript functions immediately within the HTML markup.

### Internal Javascript
Internal JavaScript is placed within a < script > tag inside the HTML document, typically in the < head > or before the closing < /body > tag. This method keeps JavaScript separate from HTML elements, improving readability and maintainability.
