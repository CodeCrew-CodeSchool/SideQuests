### Control Flow

Control flow refers to the order in which a program’s statements are executed. JavaScript, like most programming languages, follows a top-to-bottom execution model—but we can manipulate this flow using conditional statements, loops, and function calls. By controlling the logic of execution, we can build dynamic, responsive applications.

### Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow JavaScript to make decisions based on certain conditions. The most common types include:

- if...else statements -  Executes a block of code only if a condition is met.
- switch statements -  Efficiently handles multiple conditions, often used when comparing a single variable against different values.
- Ternary Operator (condition ? trueValue : falseValue) - A shorthand way of writing simple conditional statements.

### Loops
Loops are a fundamental programming feature that allows us to repeat a block of code multiple times. JavaScript offers several types of loops:

- for loop – Best for when the number of iterations is known.
- while loop – Runs as long as a specified condition is true.
- do...while loop – Similar to a while loop but guarantees at least one execution.
- forEach method – Specifically for iterating over arrays in a cleaner, more readable way.

### Logical Operators
Logical operators allow us to combine and manipulate boolean values (true or false). The three main logical operators in JavaScript are:

- AND (&&) – Returns true only if both conditions are true.
- OR (||) – Returns true if at least one condition is true.
- NOT (!) – Reverses the boolean value of an expression.


### Assignment Operators

Assignment operators allow us to assign values to variables in different ways. The most common is the = operator, but JavaScript provides several shorthand assignments:

- += – Adds and assigns (x += 5 is the same as x = x + 5).
- -= – Subtracts and assigns (x -= 3 is the same as x = x - 3).
- *=, /=, %= – Similar operations for multiplication, division, and remainder.

### Closure 
A closure is a function that retains access to its outer scope, even after the outer function has finished executing. This is a key concept in JavaScript that enables:

- Data encapsulation – Prevents variables from being accessed directly outside the function.
- State persistence – Useful for creating counters, event handlers, and private variables.

### Scope

Scope determines where variables can be accessed in your code. JavaScript has three types of scope:

- Global Scope – Variables declared outside functions can be accessed anywhere.
- Function Scope – Variables declared inside a function are only accessible within that function.
- Block Scope (with let and const) – Variables inside {} are only accessible within that block.
