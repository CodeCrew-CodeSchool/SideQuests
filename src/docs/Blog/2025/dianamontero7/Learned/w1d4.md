### Form  < form >
Think of a "form" as a digital clipboard. It’s where you gather user input—like names, emails, or feedback—and send it somewhere, usually to a server. 

### Input < input >
The "input" tag can be a text box, a checkbox, a radio button, or even a file uploader. It’s how users actually provide their info, whether it’s a search query or a password.

### Label < label >
A "label" does more than just sit next to an input field, it’s clickable. When properly linked to an input, clicking the label focuses on the field, making forms more user-friendly. 

### Button < button >
The "button" is the final step in most forms. It’s what users click to submit their information or trigger an action. Whether it says “Submit,” “Sign Up,” or “Buy Now,” it’s the gateway to getting things done.

### Text Area < textarea >
Unlike the basic input field, a "text area" is built for longer text. It expands as needed and is perfect for comments, feedback, or messages.

### Required Element 
It ensures users don’t leave important fields empty, helping to collect complete and accurate data.


### Anchor < a >
The "a" tag, better known as a link, is one of the most used elements on the web. Whether it takes you to another page, opens an email client, or jumps to a section on the same page, it keeps users navigating smoothly.
