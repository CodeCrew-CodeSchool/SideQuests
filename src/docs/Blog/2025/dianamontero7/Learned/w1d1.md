### Head

This is like the behind-the-scenes section of your webpage. It holds important info about the page, like links to stylesheets or scripts, but you won’t see any of it directly on the page.

### Meta

Think of it as your webpage’s business card. It holds details like the character set, author, and page description, which help search engines understand and categorize your content.

### Title

This is what shows up in the browser tab. It's the name of your webpage that helps both visitors and search engines quickly know what it's about.

### Body

The body is where all the visible content of your webpage lives—text, images, buttons—everything that your users will interact with is inside here.

### Headings

These are your headings, kind of like the chapter titles in a book. 'h1' is the most important and is usually your main heading, while 'h2', 'h3', etc., break things down into subcategories.

### Paragraph

A paragraph tag is used to group together sentences or thoughts into a block of text. It's a way to keep everything organized and readable.

### Button

This is your interactive element. A button lets people click on it to perform an action, like submitting a form or triggering some JavaScript magic.
