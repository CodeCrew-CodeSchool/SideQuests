## Table of Contents
### 8/4
I've learned the basic tags for HTML and how to properly format an index file using HTML. This is something that I've found relatively easy thanks to to my intstructor and freecodecamp.

### 8/5
Today we learned how to use semantic tags properly to create ordered list (ol), Unordered list (ul), and how to create tables in html. Creating tables was a little difficult at first glance but I soon understood it. we also learned some interesting things about wireframing which sets up the structure of a webpage.

### 8/6
Today was about adding videos and audio files to vscode and to integrate them properly using vscode. tags like < img >, < video >, and < audio > have all been used in today's assignment. I had difficulty starting out but I eventually picked up on it as the day went by.

### 8/11
Today was an introduction to styling with CSS. I found it intuitive and farely easy. I know now that there are multiple ways to style an html document.
