Computer: A machine used to record, store, and calculate information. The word "computer" was first used in 1963 in a book by Richard Braithwaite and originally described a human who performed calculations or computations.

Git: A version control system designed to handle projects of all sizes with speed and efficiency. It is free and open-source software.

IDE: Stands for integrated development environment. IDEs can help developers find mistakes in their code by providing debugging tools and error checks.

GUI: Stands for graphical user interfaces. GUIs allow users to interact with a computer using visual elements such as icons, buttons, and menus.

CLI: Stands for command-line interfaces. They let users interact with a computer's operating system by typing commands into a text line, and they offer access to commands that aren't available in GUIs.

Markdown: A lightweight markup language commonly used to format and structure plain text. It is designed to be easy to read and write, and typically has a ".md" extension.

WebHosting: Allows you to store your website's files on a server, making it accessible by others. It began in the early 1990s.

We will create a repo in Github, use Markdown to create our README and webpage(s), and deploy it using Github at our Github profile.
