Inline Style: An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element. To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.

Style Block: A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element. A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

External CSS: An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages. To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the head section of each HTML page.

We will learn how to use CSS for color manipulation and styling, explore different ways to include CSS in our website (Inline, Style Elements, and Link Elements), understand key concepts from the readings, and apply them to complete our lab assignment.
