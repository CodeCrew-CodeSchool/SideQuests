The pop() method removes the last element from an array and returns that element.

The push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.

The shift() method removes the first element from an array and returns that element.

The unshift() method adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.

We will master the effective use of map, filter, and reduace array methods to manipulate data, transform arrays, and perform computations effeciently. We will also develop a strong understanding of pop, push, queue, and dequeue methods to manage and modify array data structures effeciently.
