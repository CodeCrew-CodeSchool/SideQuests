Head: The head element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the html tag and the body tag. HTML metadata is data about the HTML document.

Meta: The meta tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.

Title: The title tag defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.

Body: The body tag defines the document's body. <br> The body element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

H1 to H6: Tags that are used to define HTML headings. <br> H1 defines the most important heading. H6 defines the least important heading.

P: The p tag defines a paragraph. <br> Browsers automatically add a single blank line before and after each p element.

Button: The button tag defines a clickable button. Inside a button element you can put text (and tags like i, b, strong, br, img, etc.) This is not possible with a button created with the input element.

We will get a clear understanding of semantic tags and wireframing. <br> We will also get familiar with web features such as Live Server and gain a greater understanding of how HTML5 is used to develop web applications.
