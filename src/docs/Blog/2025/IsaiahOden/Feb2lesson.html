            <p> Defining some significant terms I learned today: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>"controls" - HTML attribute that allows the user to manage their experience, i.e. adjust volume, pause/play, etc.</li>
                    <li>"iframe"- HTML element that opens the world of embedded content. I used it in my earlier blog, but it was interesting to find that there is a huge difference between video and iframe</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Describing any processes or instructions I've received today: </h4>
                <p>
                   <b><i>Honestly, today was more about practice and additional instructional knowledge for things I had already figured out.</i></b> <br>
                    <br>
                    It was interesting reading about the intricacies of metadata and finding out that each and every video player can be customized with javascript. <br>
                    Also, I learned more about the process of embedding not just videos but all the interactive content on the internet. <br>
                    Finally, I learned about the importance of all the attributes that can be added to media elements to customize the user experience and make the content more accessible.
