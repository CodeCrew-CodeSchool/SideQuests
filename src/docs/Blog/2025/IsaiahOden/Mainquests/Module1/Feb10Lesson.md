# CSS

Today was all about Cascading Style Sheets, more commonly known as CSS. CSS is what marketing created when the tech team said they could put words on the web.
CSS is used to style html websites to the user's vision, whether that be formatting, fonts, colors, etc. any sort of decorating that a website could use is done through CSS.

# Styles

Styles: how your website is designed and how it appeals to the user visually.

# Selectors

Selectors : CSS syntax used to reference specific HTML Elements in the CSS file. For example, you may have multiple div elements in a document that need to be styled differently.
You would create ID's for each of the div elements and call those selectors in your CSS file.

```
{
<div id='myname'>

</div>

<div id='myage'>

</div>
}

myname {
    *insert example css here*;
}

myage {
    *insert example css here*;
}
```

# Describing What I Learned
CSS has been challenging for me, especially concepts like padding, margins, and hexadecimal colors, which don’t naturally click. I’ve never been drawn to the fine details of design, and the trial-and-error nature of styling can be frustrating. Still, as I’ve worked through it, I’m starting to appreciate how much control CSS gives over layouts. Embracing the challenge has been tough but rewarding.
