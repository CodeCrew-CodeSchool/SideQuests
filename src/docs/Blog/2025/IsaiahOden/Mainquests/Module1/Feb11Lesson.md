# CSS

Today waas again about CSS, however this time we got into the weeds of some topics. Specifically selectors that are based on the element type, relationships, class, and/or id. It felt so satisfying to figure out how to solve the selector puzzle each time. 

# Inline vs Style vs Link

-Inline: applies CSS Styles in the same code line as the HTML element

-Style: applies CSS Styles in the same HTML file as is being altered.

-Link: applies CSS Styles by linking the HTML file to an external CSS file, usually named "style(s).css"


# Describing What I Learned
CSS Diner was awesome for learning selectors.  The game format on flukeout.github.io made it way more fun than just reading about it.  Going through each level really helped me understand how selectors work. Also, actually doing it and seeing the results made me feel way more confident in my CSS skills. It wasn't just theory, it was hands-on, and that made a huge difference.
