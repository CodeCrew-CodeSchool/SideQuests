# Module 2 Lesson 1 Introduction To Javascript

Welcome to the first blog of Module 2! Things are starting to get spicy now that we're in Javascript. The language of variables, constants, arrays, lists, types, objects, etc. It just gets the blood pumping with possibilities. Now that we know how to put words and pictures on the internet, we're going to learn how to implement advanced concepts and present them for the world to see. 

Javascript has pretty much the same concepts as python when it comes to the very basics so I didn't really learn anything new in that sense, but the minute differences in the various ways to define a variable in javascript are quite interesting.

'const'  - Used for variables that will not change value, there will be an error if you try to.

'var' - used for variables that can change in value, and you want to persist throughout the entire sheet of code.

'let' -  used for variables that can change in value, but only persist for that block of code, usually used inside of functions

Each one is used for different purposes and it can really help with understanding the purpose of code.

Describing something I else I learned would probably be defining functions and booleans in javascript, the syntax is just slightly different. Learning it is fun.
