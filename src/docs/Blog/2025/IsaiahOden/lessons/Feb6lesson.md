# Forms and Web Hosting

Not sure how web hosting ended up on this lesson, because we did all the github pages work last week. But forms were quite interesting. Since media and links we've continued learning about the interactive elements of HTML and CSS, which seems like a strong segue into Javascript.

# Forms

"<form>": the HTML element that opens up the infinite path of the internet. Once the user is able to input information, then we can collect that info and get creative with our business senses to capitalize. Where is the data stored? How is it stored? How much is it worth? Is it morally correct to sell it? We answered a few of those today with HTTP but I'm excited to learn more.

# TextArea

"<textarea>": HTML element that allows the user to input a signifcant portion of text. common in forms to allow the user to leave reviews or feedback.

# Describing What I Learned

I think the process of wireframing forms in addition to wireframing the entire site beforehand is extremely helpful in getting started. A teaser on how data is handled by HTML through HTTP Post requests was good for understanding how everything works. Finally, learning about all the various attributes is always important for making the code yours.
