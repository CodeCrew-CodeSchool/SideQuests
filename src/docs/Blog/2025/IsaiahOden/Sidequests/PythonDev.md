# Journey To Python Dev
I've been working over the weekend in Django, and I've decided to dedicate myself to becoming a Python developer. 
My sidequest learning will be centered around 3 - 4 Projects that interest me, while also allowing me to gain strong skills in a variety of tech stacks. The projects are as follows:

  1. ### Data Analytics Dashboard for Historical Events:
        
            Purpose: Visualize historical data (e.g., major events, trends over time) using interactive charts.

            Tech Stack: Django (or Dash), Pandas, Plotly/Seaborn, and possibly a public API or web scraping for data collection.
  
2. ### Algorithmic Trading Simulator & Dashboard:


        Purpose: Create a bot that fetches real‑time market data (stocks/crypto) and backtests trading strategies. Display results on an interactive dashboard.

        Tech Stack: Django REST Framework for the backend API
        Backtrader or Zipline for backtesting strategies
        TA‑Lib for technical analysis
        A front‑end dashboard using Streamlit or Dash.

        
3. ### Anime Recommendation Engine:


        Purpose: Build a system that recommends shonen anime based on user preferences and viewing history using collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.

        Tech Stack: Django or Flask for the backend, scikit‑learn for recommendation algorithms, Pandas for data processing.

4. ### DevOps and Cloud Deployment Project:


        Purpose: Containerize one of your Django projects and set up a CI/CD pipeline to deploy it to a cloud platform (Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean).
    
        Tech Stack: Docker, GitHub Actions (or GitLab CI), and cloud deployment tools.
