**Growth Mindset**
: a thinking technique that allows the user to shift their perspective to that of infinite power; in other words everything that happens in their life can be seen as a boon or blessing rather than an obstacle


## What has Changed

So the author talked about the fixed mindset in contrast to the growth mindset, which is something that opened my eyes to my own shortcomings. Although we all might understand and practice the growth mindset often, keeping it going 100% of the time is difficult. Being able to identify when the growth mindset is waning and the fixed mindset is taking over unlocks a new level of conscious living. Overall, although I was already very familiar with the growth mindset, I enjoyed the author's candid remarks on the subject and his empathathetic style of writing. It allowed me to reflect on some of my bad days as well and understand them better, understand myself better. Contextualizing the growth mindset to work and development was a very positive experience.
