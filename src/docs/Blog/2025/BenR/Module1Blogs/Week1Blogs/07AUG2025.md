## Week 2 Completed

### What up gang

Finished week two. Learned a lot of stuff. About coding, about school, about work, about love, about life...

I think I've BECOME the code. [What do the numbers mean, Mason?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVPT0JT1dOw)

It feels like I'm in an episode of Serial Experiments Lain.

Alexa, play the [Serial Experiments Lain opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM8RufZr5lw).

See you next week
