## Beginner HTML Musings
Today, I learned how to set up my HTML page. Here's the assignment we were given:

I had worked ahead a little on the curriculum, so getting started on this wasn't too bad. I just wireframed my page and got things together.

Honestly, the hardest part I had was dealing with my images. If I sourced from a URL, it was no big deal. However, sourcing from my computer was kinda weird. I tried to make a folder called "images" that was in the same folder as the index.html file I was using and copying the filepath. That did not work. I tried shortening the filepath which also didn't work. I then settled on just moving the images directly into the same folder as the index.file, and shortening the path to just the name of the image files then it worked.

Then the next part I had to deal with was figuring out why my image was sitting next to the text. I settled on using a "div" tag to separate everything. Later I was told by an instructor that a "br" tag would have been better because it's a voidtag and did exactly the same thing lol.

Lastly, my photo of me had a crazy resolution size of 6000 x 3376 px which was comically oversized. So I had to spend time putting in width and height attributes to make it smaller. I was really careful about not messing up the image ratio because I didn't want to look like I was in a circus/clown mirror guesstimating the size of the image, so I just divided the numbers by 5, 6, and 7, finally settling on diving by 6 which got me my new pixel size of 1000 x 562.7. That made things a lot better.

I sometimes also like showing off, so I threw in some subscript and I threw a link to [Katamari Damacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVVW41iAu5A) for the PS2.
