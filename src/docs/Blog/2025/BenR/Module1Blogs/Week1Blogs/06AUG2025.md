### Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying & Love the Code

I learned about <img>, <video>, <audio>, <iframe> tags. Really cool and nifty honestly.

I also learned how to size them if I need to.

I did the homework assignment pretty quickly and spent more time doing CSS on everything. I've been doing some of the FreeCodeCamp stuff, and it's been helpful.

Also W3Schools has been pretty helpful.

For some reason, I thought I could start putting my own locations for the homework assignment, so I had to ask before I got too crazy into it. So I ended up ripping from YouTube some clips from the hit TV series "Atlanta". I wanted to use Florida as a destination and play some of the Florida Man clips, but I also needed to actually do the correct assignment. When I asked, I pretty much saved myself a lot of backtracking lol.

So here's the Atlanta clip
