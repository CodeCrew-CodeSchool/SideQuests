        <h2>Beginner HTML Musings</h2>
        <p>Today, I learned how to set up my HTML page. Here's the assignment we were given:</p>

        <p>I had worked ahead a little on the curriculum, so getting started on this wasn't too bad. I just wireframed my page and got things together.
           Honestly, the hardest part I had was dealing with my images. If I sourced from a URL, it was no big deal. However, sourcing from my computer was kinda weird. I tried to make a folder called "images" that was in the same folder as the index.html file I was using and copying the filepath. That did not work. I tried shortening the filepath which also didn't work. I then settled on just moving the images directly into the same folder as the index.file, and shortening the path to just the name of the image files then it worked.  
        </p>
        <p>Then the next part I had to deal with was figuring out why my image was sitting next to the text. I settled on using a "div" tag to separate everything. Later I was told by an instructor that a "br" tag would have been better because it's a voidtag and did exactly the same thing lol.</p>
        <p>Lastly, my photo of me had a crazy resolution size of 6000 x 3376 px which was comically oversized. So I had to spend time putting in width and height attributes to make it smaller. I was really careful about not messing up the image ratio because I didn't want to look like I was in a circus/clown mirror guesstimating the size of the image, so I just divided the numbers by 5, 6, and 7, finally settling on diving by 6 which got me my new pixel size of 1000 x 562.7. That made things a lot better.</p>
        <p> I sometimes also like showing off, so I threw in some subscript and I threw a link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVVW41iAu5A">Katamari Damacy for the PS2.</a></p>
