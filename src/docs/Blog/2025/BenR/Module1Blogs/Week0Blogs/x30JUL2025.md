## **Growing Mindset**

![morrowindskoomameme](https://ibb.co/mrr8pckh)

Someone linked me [this article](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset) today to read, and I decided to write about it on my own volition without being prompted to by an instructor or as part of the curriculum :eyes:.

I agree with a lot that is said in this article. What really speaks to me is the idea of fixed mindset vs growth mindset.

I feel that personally, I've had moments where I had qualities of both. There are times where I become avoidant of things because of fear. But I find that when I've tried to perservere through them, that's where I've found the most growth. However, there were times I needed to go through a long period of fixed mindset due to loss or fatigue. I think that's okay because we need time to recover, and that's sometimes where our brains need to be.

I also enjoy the idea that brings up the idea of love of learning. I love learning, I love the idea of exercising my brain. Whenever I've let my brain not exercise, I feel a lot more sluggish and my brain fog hits harder. I feel like it keeps me sharp.

### *3 Reminders to Stay **Growing***

     1. Stay open-minded to new ideas
     2. Don't sweat the big stuff
     3. Keep yourself ground mentally, spiritually, and physically.

#### Pointless Table that Doesn't Add Anything to the Discussion, but **I** Personally Thought Would Be Funny
