It's been awhile since I updated the blog.

I was told to come up with an app idea I'd like to create by the end of Module 3. Here's the idea:

---
# Simple RPG

## Objective
It's really just a simple RPG for people to play and have fun. No need to get crazy. Kinda goofy.

It would definitely be for fans of Kingdom of Loathing or other types of games like that.

## Revenue Model

I'd like it to be free, or at the minimum a one time purchase or a very small subscription to keep the servers going. Maybe if anyone feels a labor of love type deal, they can donate a lil. That'd be really cool. I don't think it's something I'd particularly want to make money off of.

It would only be for fun and for the assignment. If it was something I wanted to get paid for, I think I'd put a ton more effort into it and get really creative. But I want to start small and the payment of experience and knowledge is much better for me in the long run.
