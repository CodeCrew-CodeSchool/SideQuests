# What I Learned Today

Today, I learned about three important HTML elements: `<iframe>`, `<audio>`, and `<video>`.

## `<iframe>`
The `<iframe>` element is used to embed another HTML document within the current document. This can be useful for displaying content from other websites, such as maps, videos, or other web pages, without leaving the current page.

## `<audio>`
The `<audio>` element is used to embed sound content in a web page. It supports various audio formats like MP3, WAV, and Ogg. This element provides controls for play, pause, and volume, making it easy to add audio playback functionality to a website.

## `<video>`
The `<video>` element is used to embed video content in a web page. It supports multiple video formats such as MP4, WebM, and Ogg. Similar to the `<audio>` element, it provides controls for play, pause, and volume, as well as additional features like subtitles and poster images.

These elements enhance the multimedia capabilities of web pages, making it easier to integrate rich content and improve user experience.
