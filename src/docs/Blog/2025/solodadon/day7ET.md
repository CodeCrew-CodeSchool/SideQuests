Today I learned about different elements and what part they play and how they can be modified inside of a browser to play media sources and how easy it is to embed a link into HTML.

elements I learned

<img>: An HTML element embeds an image into the document.
<video>:element embeds a media player which supports video playback into the document. <audio> element is used to embed sound content in documents.
<iframe> element represents a nested browsing context, embedding another HTML page into the current one
