Objects allow us to group related pieces of information. Similar to how you can describe yourself
and your belonging in terms of you (you, your shirt, your shoes) objects allow us to do this
in our software so that we can refer to an object and it's properties. This concept allows for easier 
abstractions and design larger more intricate systems, as we'll see throughout this course.
