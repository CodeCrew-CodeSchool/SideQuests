JSON: (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight text-based format for storing and exchanging data.
Inheritance:inheritance is achieved through prototypal inheritance, where objects inherit from other objects rather than classes. 
Prototypes: Prototypes allow objects to share methods without duplicating them, making memory usage more efficient.


• Composition: Composition allows objects to gain functionality by including other objects, 
leading to a more flexible and modular design. • Usefulness of Objects:Objects in JavaScript group
related variables (properties) and functions (methods) under a single entity, reducing complexity and improving data management. 
• Arrow Functions: Arrow functions provide a shorter syntax for writing functions and automatically bind
