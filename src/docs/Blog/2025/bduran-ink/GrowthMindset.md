Growth Mindset 
 
 My reflection on this article really stood out a lot.
A fixed mindset vs growth mindset has its different points on viewing and questioning yourself on your everyday life. 
My reflection on this article truly resonated with me. The difference between a fixed mindset and a growth mindset has different ways of perceiving and questioning ourselves in our daily lives. I have realize that I previously had a fixed mindset. I would react to difficult situations by thinking is this happening to me?" instead of asking, "What can I learn from this?" I would blamed myself and others for the challenges I faced. The Atlassian advice to "acknowledge avoidance, take a step back, and embrace the growth mindset" particularly struck  with me. When Iâ€™m ready now try to approach problems differently, seeking new perspectives until I begin to see a way forward.
I feel like reading article is a reminder to 
- Challenges = taking accountability to the avoidance, taking a step back and viewing things differently in multiple perspectives 
- Obstacles = owning to the lack of motivation.
- Effort = questioning your achievements "no pain no gain"
- Criticism = dark side of growth but a motive to keep moving forward.
- Success = Fixed - others success is a threat Growth- success is an inspiration.
