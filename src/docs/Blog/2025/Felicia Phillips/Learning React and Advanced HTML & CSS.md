### ⭐ Learning React and Advanced HTML & CSS

It is week 2 day 2 of Module 3 and we are currently learning about API's and Requests. So far I understand the following:

- API (Application Programming Interface) is the middleman that lets different apps talk to each other by understanding their requests.
- Request is a message sent by an application to an API, asking it for specific data or to perform a particular action.

### ⭐ Aside from react, I have also been learning more advanced HTML & CSS. Here are a few things I have learned:

### Progress <progress>

- The **progress tag < progress >** is an HTML5 element that displays the progress of a task. It's a semantic way to represent loading or the completion of a process. By default, the browsers display a looping animation to indicate progress is ongoing until a **value** is declared. 
- The value attribute specifies how much of the task has been completed.
- The max attribute specifies the total amount of work the task requires.
- After learning this, I decided to update my [scoops](https://cloverdeveloped.github.io/scoops/) game to include a loading bar !

### Keyboard Input <kbd> Ctrl </kbd> + <kbd> Alt </kbd> + <kbd> Del </kbd>

- The < kbd > HTML element is used to show text that a user is supposed to type in (like commands or instructions) or that they actually typed in (like what they entered in a form). It's displayed as inline text.
- After learning this, I decided to update my [scoops](https://cloverdeveloped.github.io/scoops/) game again to instruct the user to press space to play.

### <code>Code</code>

- The < code > HTML element is used to show computer code or text that looks like code. It helps to visually separate it from regular text and makes it easier to read as code.
