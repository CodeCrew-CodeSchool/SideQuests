### ⭐🍓🌱 Game Dev

One of my motivations for joining Code Crew was to create a browser game, and I'm thrilled to share that I've already achieved that goal in week 2 of Module 3! I successfully developed and designed an ice cream builder [game](https://cloverdeveloped.github.io/scoops/) using Adobe Illustrator for the visuals and vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the functionality. 🌟
