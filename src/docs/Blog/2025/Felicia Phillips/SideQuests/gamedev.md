### ⭐🍓🌱 Game Dev

One of my motivations to join Code Crew was to create a browser game.
🌟 We are currently in week 2 of Module 3 and I have achieved that goal.

I developed and designed a icecream builder [game](https://cloverdeveloped.github.io/scoops/) using Adobe Illustrator and vanilla html/css/javascript.
