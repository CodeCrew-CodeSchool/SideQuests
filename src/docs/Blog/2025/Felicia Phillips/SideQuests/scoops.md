- document.addEventListener() is a method that attaches an event listener to the document object. This means it will listen for events that happen anywhere within the web page.
- 'keydown' is the type of event being listened for. This event fires when a key on the keyboard is pressed down.
- function(event) { ... } is the callback function that will be executed when the 'keydown' event occurs. The event object contains information about the keyboard event that happened.
