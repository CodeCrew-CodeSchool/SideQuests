simple 3D modeling graphics of keyboard key caps. 

<kbd> A </kbd> to press anything

<kbd> S </kbd> to scale

<kbd> ctrl z </kbd> to redo

<kbd> r </kbd> to rotate

<kbd> g </kbd> to grab

the z-axis goes up and down

<kbd> e </kbd> to extrude

shift + a to add something

mouse scroll is how you zoom in and out
press scroll ball will rotate
shift + scroll entire page

tab will take you to edit mode
