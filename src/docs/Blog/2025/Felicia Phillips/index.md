## Graphic Designer and Software Developer
Hello, I'm a graphic designer and developer currently attending code school during the day and freelancing in graphic design in the evenings. I enjoy the process of learning and creating youthful websites and designs. This blog shares my journey as a software developer and the insights I gain both in and out of the classroom.

 ### ⭐ Looking ahead, I'm excited to share 10 new things I learn each week throughout the remainder of this course. I will be exploring topics such as graphic design, software development, illustration, motion graphics, and 3D modeling.
