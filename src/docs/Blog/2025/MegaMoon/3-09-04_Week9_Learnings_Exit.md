## Week9_Learnings - 3-09-04 - Blog [1^]

**Learning points (chronological order)**
- AI grant --> Use allowed and documentation requested
- Projects ("I have ALL the projects/questions!")
- Borders, colors, and initial splitting (into files) on Day 1
- React organizational differences (like building frame)
- Wide variety of tools (many bookmarks)
- More on splitting (PokeDex assignment)
- Components and intro to hooks (with Aspen) 
- Expanded my use of VSC's Chat/Agent as AI (Diner assignment)
- Asking questions and listening to answers to me and others seemed to improve my understanding a bit (Thu. morning)

Hopefully will learn more with Thursday's assignment and more work at HQ on Friday. 

### Questions 
- AI exports: VSC (after Ctrl+Alt+_) and other, faster methods (Answer Jill's question in prompts?)
- More on when to split into another file(s) or when same (Aspen "View" button versus diner Menu vs. Order) 
- Hooks are an amorphous (sp?) cloud to things-that-do-things
