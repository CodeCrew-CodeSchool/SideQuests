# Meghan's ideas - Revised Proposal List
## Rough rank from most interest or realism (to least and less)


# Proposal ONE: APOPO - Sniffer Animal Monitoring System
    ## Objective: 
    Develop and pilot a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) micro-location and physiological monitoring system (integrating geo-data and physio-monitoring sensors) for a team of APOPO sniffer animals to precisely map their search paths and performance metrics in the field.

### Purpose
    To improve the efficiency, safety, and operational protocols of APOPO's sniffer animal programs (landmines, TB, or wildlife trade) by providing handlers and researchers with precise, data-driven insights into animal performance and search coverage.

### Target Audience
    APOPO animal handlers, trainers, and R&D support staff [^1] 

## Revenue Model
    Freeware (Leveraged for grants and hackathons to secure funding for later development stages).



# Proposal TWO: Pet Nutrition - Crowd-Sourced Data Platform
    ## Objective: 
    Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) data collection platform (via web and/or mobile app) to successfully gather crowd-sourced feeding, health, and behavioral data for a minimum of 500 dogs and/or cats over a 3-month period.

### Purpose
    Create a large, normalized, ***agentic*** dataset that can be utilized by AI/LLMs to generate exponentially better, evidence-based insights for pet owners and veterinarians regarding pet food efficacy, health outcomes, and behavior.

### Target Audience
    Pet food producers, pet food and treat suppliers, pet owners, and veterinarians. [^2] 

## Revenue Model
    Subscription (Charge a minimal monthly fee for pet owners, but consider charging companies and doctors larger fees for access to subsets of structured data).



# Proposal THREE: OpenExo - Open-Source Modular Exoskeleton Application
    ## Objective: 
    Develop a functional software module/library (e.g., for motion control, sensor data processing, or user interface) to support one defined biomechanical function of the OpenExo, targeting either diabetes wound care support or scoliosis motion guidance.

### Purpose
    Contribute high-quality, tested, open-source code that will accelerate the biomedical community's research and development of affordable, modular exoskeletons, thus potentially improving patient care and quality of life.

### Target Audience
    Biomedical community (Test patients, university researchers, and doctors).

## Revenue Model
    Freeware (Leveraged for grants and hackathons to secure funding for later development stages).



# Proposal FOUR: APOPO - High-Precision Micro-location Tracker
    ## Objective: 
    Design and build a prototype micro-location hardware and software system capable of recording a sniffer animal's position with sub-centimeter accuracy in a controlled test environment, and integrate this data with a basic mapping interface.

### Purpose
    Introduce high-precision spatial data into APOPO's mine clearance operations, which will allow for more efficient field-stripping and reduced demining time, ultimately saving lives and returning land to communities faster.

### Target Audience
    APOPO animal handlers, trainers, and support staff [^1] 

## Revenue Model
    Freeware (towards grants and hackathons for later development stages, then transitioning to Purchase or Subscriptions for sale to other NGOs, research facilities, or commercial scent-detection services).



# Proposal FIVE: Code Crew - Job Search Readiness App
    ## Objective: 
    Develop and launch an MVP mobile/web application that provides students with a clear, module-by-module timeline of job search steps, integrated with tools for tracking applications and interview readiness, achieving a 90% student engagement rate within the first cohort.

### Purpose
    Significantly increase the likelihood of student job placement within four weeks of graduation by providing a structured, engaging, and early-start guide to the tech job search process.

### Target Audience
    Code Crew High School and adult students and CC staff members for activity enhancement or replacement.

## Revenue Model
    Freeware (Leveraged for grants and hackathons to secure funding, with plans to expand and offer a licensed Purchase or Subscription model to other non-profit bootcamps and educational programs).



# Proposal SIX: Outdoor Afro App (OA) - Memphis Content Boost
    ## Objective: 
    Implement a data aggregation and initial content generation tool that utilizes web scraping and community feedback to populate the Outdoor Afro app with a minimum of 20 high-quality, verified Memphis outdoor resource listings and an initial content-based rating.

### Purpose
    Showcase and promote Memphisâ€™s outdoor and related health resources to the local African American community and national OA users, thereby increasing local engagement and encouraging a focus on well-being

### Target Audience
    Metro Memphis' African American community and nation-wide Outdoor Afro app users considering where to vacation [^3] 

## Revenue Model
    Donation (Propose a one-time donation to Outdoor Afro in return for the ability to use the project on LinkedIn, personal websites, and portfolios to demonstrate coding and social impact skills)



# Proposal SEVEN: Zooniverse

## Objective
    Develop a research project for which hospital patients at St. Jude and elsewhere can contribute as citizen scientists.

### Purpose
    Identify a research project that can be done from bed through windows (birds &/or insects) to promote mental and ecological health

### Target Audience
    Identify a research project that can be done from bed through windows (birds &/or insects) to promote mental and ecological health

## Revenue Model
    (Note: A specific Objective and Purpose are not listed in the original quote for Zooniverse, so this section is maintained for structure, but is incomplete.)



**MC notes**

[^1] ## Objective: Develop and pilot a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) micro-location and physiological monitoring system (integrating geo-data and physio-monitoring sensors) for a team of APOPO sniffer animals to precisely map their search paths and performance metrics in the field. Support Apopo's mission for mines, illegal wildlife trade, or tuberculosis with micro-locational data and ML or AI for possible interpretations and variables; geo-data, physio- and enviro-monitoring, and emerging tech
