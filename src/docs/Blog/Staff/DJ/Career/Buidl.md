"Building in Public" is a GREAT way to learn and grow as a developer, and any passion you have really. 

Utilizing the actual tech you're working with (the internet and computers) connect and showcase your progress and growth. Documenting what you know in a format for others to consume helps your brain solidify what you're learning as you're not just taking in the info, but you have to communicate what it actually is that you're learning and doing. It will also help you to get in touch with those who know more, inspire other learners like you, and eventually, your body of work will be a proof of your skills and capabilities. This will eventually help you in your hunt for clients and job opportunities and put you in a position to give back and help the next generation of learners.
