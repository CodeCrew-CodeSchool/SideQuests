# Programmers vs High Level Languages

This podcast, Advent of Computing, is a pretty amazing deep dive into the history of computing.

On this particular episode is about the advent of "higher level" languages like Fortran and eventually C.

Programmers of the day wrote assembly language and the experts enjoyed the granular level of control of computer hardware, fearing that the binary machine code generated by these new languages would be inefficient at best and horribly wrong in the worst of situations.

One Dr. Dr. even mailed in a complaint to the ACM about the pitfalls of Fortran

Funny how the more things change, the more they stay the same
