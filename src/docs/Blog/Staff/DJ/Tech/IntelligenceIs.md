# Intelligence Is...

I've watched 3 videos this past week about the brain, intelligence, and artificial intelligence. I think these are some insightful talks from some brilliant folks.

Check them out and let me know what do you think?

John Carmack discusses his learnings from Keen Technologies, where they're focusing on Reinforcement Learning instead of Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop AI that can dynamically process information and respond to it. 
Of course, as he'll tell you himself, his background in video games and VR informs his AI research by examining how to develop a system that can see a game, as we do, and then decide how to interact with the game. Very interesting progress they're making. Seems like an approachable mini project that more of us could replicate.

## [... Behind Our Cyborg Tendencies](https://youtu.be/FASMejN_5gs?si=WMqkkPT0HwJS_ec2)

Elon Musk's Neuralink shares an update on their work in human-computer interaction, enabling interaction at the speed of thought. Improved mouse and keyboard usage, playing Mario Kart, and working remotely are all things they showcase. Elon also reiterated the hopeful point of this tech, potentially reconnecting those with spinal/neurological disabilities with their bodies...

## [... What Even is Intelligence?](https://youtu.be/jwr1EOvAxQI?si=d5Cc42Fx7AH4VxZW)

Claire Evans's talk explores the concept of intelligence. She takes us through all the signs of intelligence visible from rocks to unicellular organisms. These insights can help us improve our devices, lives, and environments if properly understood.
