### Day 1 Talk Highlight
One of my favorite topics was given by Erik Hersman of Gridless Mining. His team is working with local infrastructure to build and power grids where there was once little incentive and demand to build out grids to supply such spread out and small communities.
Using Bitcoin mining to meet the capacity of existing sites, more and more localities are able to fully utilize their power sources and even expand to provide additional power for low cost.
