Computing the Cost of Deferred Dreams

The 90s. What a time to be alive.

New tech, new music, great food, amazing (now antique) cars.
    -Game Boy Color, Outkast, Pizza Hut, 91 Burgundy Caprice Classic-

Small town Middle Class lifestyle -> Easy to be an early adopter

Shifting into college/Adulthood with the Great Recession hit hard

No money to get latest consoles, games, computers, etc. 
No time to play
Fear of waste
Heard about Bitcoin... Didn't fully get it.
Didn't take it seriously as Occupy Wall Street fizzled out. Only thought of it as "Video Game Money", so it got backseated in my mind

Coming back home, conditions were declining
less reading, less new/small businesses thriving

Less opportunity in the market

Travelled across country to upskill and find gainful employment
Talked about Bitcoin Mining with my cohort in VA. Still didn't acquire any. Didn't try to mine, didn't understand hardware. 
Mainly understood programming fundamentals, databases, SDLC, a couple of web frameworks...

COMPLETELY missed the 1st epoch of Bitcoin trying to succeed in the same system I spent criticizing for so long.

Work, Life, Love, Growth, No Bitcoin

Career Grew Slowly But Surely, Few Games were made, No Bitcoin was acquired

Pandemic Rabbit Hole

Down Payment for Home (Could have had enough to buy a few homes)

Deeper Knowledge, Programming Bitcoin

Opportunity Cost
Build the Future, Don't Wait. You Won't Be Able to Afford It Later. No One Else Will Save You
You have to Save (for) Yourself

Build that timeline you see
