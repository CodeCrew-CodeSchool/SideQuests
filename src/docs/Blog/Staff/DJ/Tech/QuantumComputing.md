# Quantum Programming 

One of my random rabbit holes this week was Quantum Computing.

After perusing [SBIR](https://sbir.gov) contracts, I stumbled across a request for proposal to harden systems against quantum computing vulnerabilities.

That led me to look into what progress has been made. To my pleasant surprise, there's a bit going on in that space. There is assembly level language that has been established and even libraries in languages like Python that can be used to create programs.

There seems to be a bit of additional logic to reason about, but nothing completely foreign if you're familiar with computer science and the basic premise of quantum mechanics and qubits.

If you find something out more, do let me know. I may have to table this research for later.
