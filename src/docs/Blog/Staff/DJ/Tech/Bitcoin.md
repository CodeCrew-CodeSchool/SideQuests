# Bitcoin

This will be the first in a series of posts about the Bitcoinization of Memphis, TN.

Fresh off the heels of the 3rd Unconference by [My First Bitcoin](https://myfirstbitcoin.io) held in conjunction with this year's Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, I'm excited to share my thoughts, intentions and goals in teaching Bitcoin, including:

- Building a Local Bitcoin Economy
- Financial Literacy Classes
- Hardware and Software Workshops focused on Bitcoin
- Whatever you can imagine

As I gather and flesh out those thoughts, feel free to dive into the resources below to get caught up on what Bitcoin is. More content to come!

<!-- Some more visible online Bitcoin spaces can be way more memetic than they are formal, and while that speaks to me, translating that to the general public and the elders hasn't gone as well so far. Financial literacy and empowerment is at the heart of what Bitcoin offers; anything else really will be icing on the cake. -->
