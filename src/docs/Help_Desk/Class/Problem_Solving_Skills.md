## Model your Domain

Describe all the pieces involved

1. What does your Model DO?

2. What actions can your Model perform?

3. Most actions can be reduced to CRUD operations

You can:

- Create something

- Read something

- Update something

- Delete something

There doesn't have to just be 1 of these, there will usually be multiples where you're either acting on
1 or Multiple
A single object or a combination of objects

## Systems Analysis

Models aren't effective for just a single item. Even the body example is actually a system made of many different parts. Walking isn't just the translocation of the body from point A to Point B, it is also the coordination of your joints, skeleton, muscles, brain, and more to actively make your body move.

In IT, we are moving information from Point A to Point B via APIs, the creation of files, the execution of methods and programs.
Modeling a system includes:

### Model System Components

### Model System Interactions

Example

Weekly Updates

SCS DB Upgrade

MS SQL DB Schema

Extract

Transform

upLoad

Oracle Cloud DB


## IRL Situations

Working in software, people will need you to be able to do the above well. You will likely go to a few different lines of business, even within the same company, if you're a good problem solver.

By modeling what your company does, you can more easily see pitfalls in operations. 

Are there actions that aren't being done?

Are they being done incorrectly or inefficiently?
