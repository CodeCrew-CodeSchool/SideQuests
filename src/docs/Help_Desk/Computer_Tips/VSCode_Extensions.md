### Material Theme Icons

Material Theme Icons is a very useful extension for people when coding, despite how simple it is, once you start using it you can never go back. Material Theme Icons provides your IDE with icons for a variety of file types, folder types, and more. It turns your normal, boring folder, to having an icon that helps you tell the difference between others. Your programming files will have unique file icons, helping you keep track, and make your folders look a little less cluttered.

### Live Server

Live server is a very essential feature to have as a developer starting out, it provides the user with a development server to watch their changes on their website in real time. As a developer starting out, you get lost easily, and that's okay! Using Live Server will provide you with a chance to see what the items you add to your site does, with color changes, or new pages.

I would recommend to use Live Server always, so go ahead and give it a try, it doesn't hurt:

### Live Share

Live Share, unlike the similar name, Live Server, is a very different extension. However, its very powerful in its own way. If Live Server is your local development server, Live Share is your collaboration server with others. It allows you to edit code, and debug in real time with others, allowing faster programming especially during lab time with classmates. Its a really fun option for people to be on two different computers, but working together.

Go ahead and give it a try:
