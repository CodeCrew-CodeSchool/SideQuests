Sometimes taking a step back from the current issue you're facing is a great way to calm your mind, remind yourself of why you're doing this, and reminding yourself of where you will be if you don't face this issue, doing these steps helps maintain a growth-oriented mindset.</p> <p>The growth mindset is also about facing situations differently. When receiving criticism, instead of trying to disprove it, you instead can think it over adn come to a conclusion for yourself.

They also believe that if you're not good at something, you'll never be good at it which limits them from reaching their full potential. So the difference between these two mindsets is that a growth mindset embraces and is open to learning new things through constant perserverance, where as, a fixed mindset believes that even if you work hard it doesn't make a difference so they're more prone to quit alot quicker in comparison.</p> <p>## 5 Key aspects to keep in mind that will help you form a better mindset.</p>"},{"location":"Blog/2024/Mayaangelouj/Portfolio/Growthmindset/#1challenges","title":"1.Challenges","text":"<p>embracing challenges rather than feeling the need to avoid them will help you overcome them and find a new perspective or way to reach your end goal.</p>"},{"location":"Blog/2024/Mayaangelouj/Portfolio/Growthmindset/#2obstacles","title":"2.Obstacles","text":"<p>when unexpected situations arise,  don't allow yourself to lose focus due to not understanding the material or skill your working on.

It is an embodiment of will, fortitude, accountability, and discipline. Growth is the result of embracing the inevitibility of change and the ability to change which requires acknowledgement; the realization that there is an issue. You cannnot and will not grow if you cannot decipher the issues that arise. Have no fear, to make room for growth is to understand why there is a need for it. Feelings of discomfort arise when its time to grow. Remember this.</p> <p>The most important steps in the process of growth are will and discipline. To grow is to change; you must be willing to do better and actually do better. Discipline the highest, most potent form of self love because it is the catalyst for and embodiment of growth. How? It requires consistency. You have to want to grow in order to do so. Growth manitfests in every aspect of life with acceptance for where you are currently and to understand where and why growth is necessary. To grow is to evolve - the puropse of humanity; requiring personal commitment to getting out of your own way, fiercly dedicating to being better, and understanding its all apart of the process. It's a personal investment meaning you get out what you put in. Innerstand you have to want it more than you love the idea of it.</p> <ul> <li>Progress will ALWAYS be better than perfection. </li> </ul> <p>Striving for perfection activates a rabbit hole of procrastination and self doubt trying to reach something unattainable. Perfection isn't an \"goal\", but rather a hinderance of growth. In fact, it's the thin line between patience and procrastination. You have to excercise patience in order to grow, but don't trick yourself into your own undoing because its not \"perfect\".</p> <ul> <li>To reap what you sow, you must practice what you preach.</li> </ul> <p>Divine alignment only exists with divine embodiment. To see growth, you have to actively grow. DO what you know you need to do, regardless of how you feel because feelings come and go, but action breeds progress and progress leads to growth.</p> <ul> <li>The most important thing to remember is: you have to wage war on the weakest parts of yourself in order to be come stronger.  </li> </ul> <p>Survival of the fittest encompasses the very nature of all living species. If you are weak in the wild, you become prey. It is in our very nature to evolve because that is how we survive. Growth is the result of making change. Want to grow? You have to shed the parts of you that distract you from doing what is necessary. Sometimes you have to push past your breaking point to innerstand that you're stronger than your mind allows you to believe. Sometimes you need to hit rock bottom to realize it's only up from there.

As seen in Psychologytoday.com Today I was given the oppurtunity to read How You Can Benefit From a Growth mindset . While Reading this article I came to the realization that I have a growth mindset. This is an attribute that is important to have when trying to survive through certain situations and obstacles in life. With out the proper skills, moving through life appears to be more challenging. Without a growth mindset you will find yourself stuck in a never-ending cycle of lack of motivation. lack of motivation can lead to but is not lmited to:</p> <p>-Loss of Job  -Loss of Relationship(s)  -Loss of Money </p> <p>In this blog I will better explain Growth Mindset, What it means to have a growth mindset, What a growth mindset looks like, and how to start thinking with a Growth Mindset. </p> <p>What it Means to have a Growth Mindset</p> <p>A Growth mindset would be the opposite os a fixed mindset. \"A fixed mindset assumes that intelligence and skills are relatively set. People with a fixed mindset strongly believe that \u2018you either have what it takes to succeed or don\u2019t\u2019. They view competence as an innate quality, something they\u2019re born with and that can\u2019t be developed further.\" As seen on  HARAPPA.Education . To have a growth mindset you need to be able to look at an obstacle or situation from another point of view. If you only see life from your point of view; how will you be able to overcome the obstacles you face. You will continue to see the obstacles through a single lense versus a multi-focal lense. Looking at your obstacles through a single lense could stunt your growth.Let's proceed to gain better knowledge on what a growth mindset looks like.</p> <p>What a Growth Mindset looks like</p> <p>A Growth mindset requires you to constantly evolve and evolving requires change. Evolving means to develop gradually, or to cause someone or something to develop gradually. As seen on Dictionary.Cambridge.Org . A growth mindset requires intrinsic motivation. Intrisic motivation is a deep desire for more. You want better for yourself and the people around you. Yearning for growth in you personal life as well as professional, and having a growth mindset will help to keep you from being stagnant. To be able to have a growth mindset you have to be open to change. When I think about growth mindset versus fixed mindset, I think of the older generation. Most people in the older generation have a fixed mindset. As alot of people would say they are \"stuck in their ways\". Most of the younger generation have become accustomed to change because, some many things have changed so quickly in our life span so far. For people with a fixed mindset, how do you start thinking with a growth mindset?</p> <p></p> <p>How to start thinking with a Growth mindset</p> <p>The first step would be to view growth mindset examples versus fixed mindset examples. As you compare the scenarios try to think about which response to the scenario resonates with you. A great example of a person with a growth mindset would be someone who works in information technology. Technology is always evolving. To be able to keep up with new technology and programs created you have to be able to continuously learn. A person with a fixed mindset would not be open to learning anything new on a subject they feel they have already mastered. When you encoutner a situation you have been in before, think about how you responded last time. What would be a different approach that would allow you to have better results? A growth mindset requires thinking, especially \"outside of the box\" thinking.</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>A growth mindset is vital to progression. Without growth we become stagnant or stuck. with a fixed mindset there is no room for growth. In an ever-changing world one needs to be open to change and capable of change. You can only grow if you change your response, change your thought process, or think of something new and different. You can have a growth mindset if you live by this saying. Learn something new everyday! </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Blog/2024/ibracho/","title":"Isabel's First Blog","text":""},{"location":"Blog/2024/ibracho/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>My name is Isabel</p> <p>I'm 24 years old.

Having a growth mindset equips you with the mental resilience to navigate these challenges. Instead of throwing in the towel when faced with difficulties, you see them as opportunities to learn and grow. </li> <li>Embrace Effort as the Path to Mastery:    The road to success is rarely a smooth, paved highway. It's more like a rugged, winding trail that demands effort, dedication, and perseverance. A growth mindset understands that mastery comes from hard work and embraces the journey, setbacks and all. </li> <li>Don't Be Afraid to Fail:    In a fixed mindset, the fear of failure can hinder progress. A growth mindset, on the other hand, sees failure as a stepping stone to success. It encourages a love for learning, pushing you to constantly improve and refine your skills.</li> </ul> <p>I am currently reading \"Mindset: The New Psychology of Success\" by Carol Dweck.
